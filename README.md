### Hello!

I'm a second year student studying computer science at Victoria University of Wellington. I'm mainly interested in systems programming and security however I occasionally venture out into web development and have also recently taken interest in programming languages and the technologies relating to them.

Here's some things I have recently been doing:

 - [Î¼boot](https://github.com/0x90nz/microboot) - A small bootloader and operating environment for x86 computers
 - [turing2d](https://github.com/0x90nz/turing2d) - A 2D turing machine simulator, try it [here](https://0x90nz.github.io/turing2d/)
