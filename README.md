### Hello!

I'm a third year student studying computer science at Victoria University of Wellington. I'm mainly interested in systems programming, security and backend programming in general. I do occasionally venture out into web development, so in future there'll probably be more of that here.

#### Programming Languages

I'm most comfortable with `Java`, `C`, `C++`, `Python` and `C#`. I've also used `Haskell`, `Prolog`, `PHP`, `Assembly (x86)`, `JavaScript`, and `TypeScript` to a lesser extent.

#### Projects

Here's some things I have recently been doing:

 - [Î¼boot](https://github.com/0x90nz/microboot) - A small bootloader and operating environment for x86 computers
 - [turing2d](https://github.com/0x90nz/turing2d) - A 2D turing machine simulator, try it [here](https://0x90nz.github.io/turing2d/)
